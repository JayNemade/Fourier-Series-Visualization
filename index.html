          <h1>Introduction</h1>
          <p>
            This project is on the demonstration of fourier series 
            by visulizing the finite-infinite sum of sines and cosines.
            The concept behind the fourier series was given by a brilliant
            mathematician by the name of, Joseph Fourier. The idea of the original
            paper was that any arbitrary periodic function could be represented by
            a specific sum of sines and cosines.<br>
          </p>
          <p>
            The theme behind this webpage is 
            that even a layman should understand the key concepts behind the fourier series so 
            the language would be simplistic and using <i>'complex'</i> mathematical concepts 
            will be avoided. If you want to know more about the topic citations will be provided. If you are already familiar with 
            fourier series, you can skip to <a href="#instructions" class="intern-links">Instructions for use</a>.
          </p>
          <h1>Basics of trignometry</h1>
          <p>
            Before understanding the fourier series we must know what is
            a sin() and a cos() function.
          </p>
          <h2>Sine wave/function</h2>
          <p>
            Mathematically the sine of an angle in a right angled triangle is the
            ratio of it's opposite side and it's hypotenuse. Thus sine is a
            function of a variable angle. In this project we look at the graph of
            this function as the position of a point on a moving circle. This is
            shown below or, you can view an animated
            version by sliding the <a href="#canvas" class="intern-links">slider
            for n to 1.</a> <br>
          </p>

          <h2>Cosine wave/function</h2>
          <p>
            Like wise the cosine function is obtained from the ratio of the
            Adjacent side and the hypotenuse. It is the sine function itself but
            with a phase shifted of 90 degrees.

          <h2>Relationship between the osscilation and the sine wave produced by it</h2>
          <p>
            The Sine wave has some properties which we should be aware of. The sine wave has a
            wavelength <b>&lambda;</b> and an Amplitude <b>A</b>.<br>Wavelength <b>&lambda;</b> is
            defined as the time required for the function to complete one full osscilation.
            Thus <b>&lambda;</b> is inversly proportional to the speed of the osscilation or the <a href="#canvas" class="intern-links">time period</a>.<br>
            The Amplitude <b>A</b> is defined as the height of the wave. Therefore <b>A</b> is directly proportional to the <a href="#canvas" class="intern-links">radius</a>.
            <br>.

          <h1>Concept behind the Fourier series</h1>
          <p>
            A Fourier series<a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/FourierSeries.html" class="cit-links"><sup>
            [1]</sup></a> is an expansion of a <b>periodic function</b><a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PeriodicFunction.html" class="cit-links"><sup>
            [2]</sup></a> <i><b>f
            (x)</b></i> in terms of an infinite sum of sines and cosines. Fourier series make use of the orthogonality<a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/OrthogonalFunctions.html" class="cit-links"><sup>
            [3]</sup></a> relationships of the sine and
            cosine functions, i.e., their graphs at any point intersect at right
            angle. The
            computation and study of Fourier series is known as <b>harmonic
            analysis</b>.

          <h1 id="instructions">Where, When and How to use this visualization</h1>
          <h2>Where is the use of this project</h2>
          <p>
            The sole use of this project is in academics. Professors can use this visualization
            if they are teaching harmonic analysis. Professors can use this visualization to
            a more intuitive way to approach fourier series. It also gives a intresting touch to 
            the so considered <i>'boring topics'</i> like fourier series.
          </p>
          <h2>How to use the visualization</h2>
          <p>
            <li>The sliders for the value of time period, radius, number of iterations are given
            just below the animation on the left.</li>
            <li>As you change the values, the animation is morphed live and you can observe the
             effect of change in the different parameters on the fourier sum which is visualized 
             in the animation.</li>
            <li>The functions can be selected by the selection menu on 
            the right of the sliders.</li>
            <li>All of the sliders and selection menus are labeled for convenience.</li>
